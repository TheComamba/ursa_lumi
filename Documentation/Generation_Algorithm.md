# Generation Algorithm

Ursa Lumi is heavily based on [Robin2010][Robin2010].

At the moment, it only supports generating galactic objects.

## Generation Parameters

The following parameters need to be specified when starting a simulation:
- `observer_position_in_pc`: This describes the `x`, `y` and `z` coordinate of an observer relative to the galactic center.

    This value cannot be changed in follow-up generations.
- `apparent_magnitude_limit`: Together with the `observer_position` this restricts the minimal brightness a star must have to be included in the output.

    Currently this value can also not be changed in follow-up generations, so choose it wisely.
- `max_distance_in_pc`: The maximal distance up to which new stars are generated in this generation run.
- `chunksize_in_pc`: The length of the edges of chunks in which calculations are processed.

    This value cannot be changed in follow-up generations.

The generation parameters are stored together with the output.

## Chunking the Galaxy

For the initial generation of stars the local environment of the observer is separated into chunks. Each chunk is a cube with edges that span `chunksize_in_pc` as given by the Generation Parameters. It is denoted $S_C$ here. A chunk is characerised by the three ordinates of one of its corners. The first chunk contains the observer at its center. Its corner is therefore at the position
$$C_0 = P_{\text{observer}} - \frac{1}{2}(S_C,S_C,S_C) .$$

> The sun is at a distance of $8.2$ kpc from the center of the milky way. Generating stars up to that distance with a chunksize of $S_C=15$ pc results in
> $$\frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{{8200}^3}{{15}^3} \approx 7\cdot10^8$$
> chunks.

Due to [branch prediction][branch-prediction], later steps will be faster on the CPU if chunks with similar properties are processed close to each other. Therefore, an algorithm that generates them sorted by their distance is used:

- Calculate `N = floor(max_distance / CHUNKSIZE)`, the number of chunks between the origin and the maximum generation distance along an axis.
- Generate indices for the first octant: For $i_x\geq0$, $i_y\geq0$ and $i_z\geq0$ where
    $$ i_x\leq N,$$
    $$ i_x^2 + i_y^2 \leq N^2,$$
    $$ i_x^2 + i_y^2  + i_z^2 \leq N^2 $$
    emplace $(i_x,i_y,i_z)$ in the vector.
- Sort the vector by distance.
- Create a new vector for all coordinates.
    > Its size is known beforehand and can be allocated.
- Find the zero-chunk containing the `observer_position` at its center.
- Loop through all entries in the octant and all sign combinations $\pm_{x,y,z}$ (in that order, working our way outwards).
  - We need to avoid duplicates coming from the fact that `+0 == -0`. Therefore,
    if `i_x == -0`, `i_y == -0` or `i_z == -0`, continue.`
  - Add a chunk at $C_0 + (\pm_x i_x,\pm_y i_y,\pm_z i_z) S_C$ to the vector, where $C_0$ is the position of the observer chunk.

## Adding Stars

Stars in the milky way can be divided in several different populations. Each of these populations has different properties:
- The current age of stars in a population can either be a range, or a specific value that's basically the same for all. In case of white dwarfs, the age is irrelevant because of the vast timescales on which they develop.
- The local density $\rho_0$ can be consered a constant scale factor of the mass density of stars in a given population.
- The axis ratio $\epsilon$ is the ratio of _scale height_ and _scale length_: The stellar mass density for many populations in the milky way exponentially decreases on a characteristic height scale when moving above or below the galactic plane, and it decreases on a charactersitic length scale when moving outwards radially.

Parameters for the different populations are given as follows (copied from [Robin2010][Robin2010], Table 1):
|Population|Age [Gyr]| $\rho_0$ [$M_\odot \text{pc}^{-3}$] | $\epsilon$ | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Thin disc | $0-0.15$ | $4.0\cdot10^{-3}$ | $0.0140$ |
|| $0.15-1$ | $7.9\cdot10^{-3}$ | $0.0268$ | 
|| $1-2$ | $6.2\cdot10^{-3}$ | $0.0375$ |
|| $2-3$ | $4.0\cdot10^{-3}$ | $0.0551$ |
|| $3-5$ | $4.0\cdot10^{-3}$ | $0.0696$ |
|| $5-7$ | $4.9\cdot10^{-3}$ | $0.0785$ |
|| $7-10$ | $6.6\cdot10^{-3}$ | $0.0791$ |
|| White dwarf | $3.96\cdot10^{-3}$ | - |
| Thick disc | $11$ | $1.34\cdot10^{-3}$ | - |
|| White dwarf | $3.04\cdot10^{-4}$ | - |
| Spheroid | $14$ | $9.32\cdot10^{-6}$ | $0.76$ |
| Bulge | $10$ | - | - |

Section 2.1.1. of [Robin2003][Robin2003] lists the total masses of the different populations. Together with the density laws listed below, this leads to values for the normalisation factors $d_0$.
| Population | Total Mass [$M_\odot$] | $d_0$ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thin disc | $2.15\cdot 10^{10}$ | TODO |
| Thick disc | $3.91\cdot 10^9$ | TODO |
| Spheroid | $2.64\cdot 10^8$ | TODO |
| Bulge | $2.03\cdot 10^{10}$ | - |

### Density Laws

Given a mass density $\rho_m$, and assuming that it is basically constant within a chunk, we can find the expected total mass inside that chunk as
$$\langle m_{tot} \rangle = \rho_m(C) S_C^3,$$
where
- $C$ are the corner coordinates of the chunk.
- $S_C$ is the chunksize.

According to Table 2 of [Robin2010][Robin2010], the mass densities for the different populations are given by the following forumlae:

#### Young Thin Disc Stars (age $\leq 0.15$ Gyr)

Given the radial distance from the galactic center $R^2 = x^2+y^2$, the density at a position is modelled as
$$\rho_m(R,z) = \frac{\rho_0}{d_0 k_\text{flare}}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{a^2}{h_+^2}\right) - \exp\left(-\frac{a^2}{h_-^2}\right)\right] ,$$
where
- $d_0$ is a normalization factor to have a density of 1 at the solar position.
- $k_\text{flare} = 1 + (R-R_\text{flare})g_\text{flare}H(R-R_\text{flare})$ accounts for the increase of the thickness of the disc with galactocentric distance.
- $R_\text{flare} = 9500$ pc is the flare radius.
- $g_\text{flare} = 0.545\cdot10^{-6}\text{ pc}^{-1}$ is a flare parameter.
- $H(R-R_\text{flace})=\left\lbrace \begin{matrix} 1&, &R\geq R_\text{flare} \\ 0&, &R< R_\text{flare} \\ \end{matrix} \right.$ is the Heavyside step-function which assures that the flare factor only plays a role after a certain radius (compare [Robin2003][Robin2003], Sec. 2.1.3).
- $a^2 = R^2 + \left(z / \epsilon / k_\text{flare}\right)^2$ is a somewhat adjusted distance from the galactic center, where the scale height $\epsilon$ is scaled by the flare factor (compare [Robin2003][Robin2003], Sec. 2.1.3).
- $h_+ = 5000$ pc is a radial decay length dominating at larger distances.
- $h_- = 3000$ pc is another radial decay length dominating at smaller distances.
- $\rho_0$ and $\epsilon$ are taken from the table above. 

[todo_density]: <Determine normalization factor d_0>

#### Older Thin Disc Stars (age $> 0.15$ Gyr)

$$\rho_m(R,z) = \frac{\rho_0}{d_0 k_\text{flare}}\left[\exp\left(-\sqrt{0.25 + \frac{a^2}{h_+^2}}\right) - \exp\left[-\sqrt{0.25 + \frac{a^2}{h_-^2}}\right)\right] ,$$
where
- $h_+ = 2530$ pc is a radial decay factor dominating at larger distances.
- $h_- = 1320$ pc is another radial decay factor dominating at smaller distances.
- the other parameters are the same as before.

#### Inner Thick Disc Stars ($|z| \leq x_l$)

$$\rho_m(R,z) = \frac{\rho_0}{d_0 k_\text{flare}} \exp \left( - \frac{R-R_\odot}{h_R} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{z^2}{h_z x_l (2 + x_l / h_z)}\right)  ,$$
where
- $x_l = 72$ pc is a height threshold.
- $R_\odot = 8.2$ kpc is the disctance of the sun from the galactic center.
- $h_R = 4000$ pc is a radial decay length.
- $h_z = k_\text{flare} \cdot 1200$ pc is a decay hight adjusted by the flare factor.
- the other parameters are the same as before.

[todo_scale_height]: <Have I correctly implemented the flare factor here?>

#### Outer Thick Disc Stars ($|z| > x_l$)

$$\rho_m(R,z) = \frac{\rho_0}{d_0 k_\text{flare}}\exp \left( - \frac{R-R_\odot}{h_R} - \frac{|z|}{h_z}\right) \frac{\exp \left( \frac{x_l}{h_z} \right)}{1 + \frac{x_l}{2h_z} }  ,$$
where all parameters are the same as before.

Note that [Robin2010][Robin2010] lists this formula without the factors $d_0$ and $k_\text{flare}$, but comparing to [Robin2003][Robin2003], I think they may have been forgotten here.

#### Inner Spheroid ($a \leq a_c$)

$$\rho_m(R,z) = \frac{\rho_0}{d_0} \left( \frac{a_c}{R_\odot}\right)^{-2.44}  ,$$
where
- $a_c = 500$ pc describes the boundary of a spheroid.
- the other parameters are the same as before.

Note that the density for the population in this regime is constant.

#### Outer Spheroid ($a > a_c$)

$$\rho_m(R,z) = \frac{\rho_0}{d_0} \left( \frac{a}{R_\odot}\right)^{-2.44}  ,$$
where all parameters are the same as before.

Note that [Robin2010][Robin2010] lists this formula without the normalisation factor $d_0$, but comparing to [Robin2003][Robin2003] and considering that the density should probably be continuous at $a = a_c$, it was probably forgotten.

#### Inner Bulge ($\sqrt{x_B^2+y_B^2} \leq R_c$)

$$\rho_N(x_B,y_B,z_B) = N \exp\left( - 0.5 r_s^2 \right)  ,$$
where
$$r_s^2 = \sqrt{\left[\left(\frac{x_B}{x_0}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y_B}{y_0}\right)^2\right]^2 + \left(\frac{z_B}{z_0}\right)^4}$$
and (compare [Robin2003][Robin2003], Table 5)
- $x_B$, $y_B$ and $z_B$ are the cartesian coordinates in the bulge's frame of reference.
- $\alpha = 78.9^\circ$ is the angle between the bulge major axis and the line perpendicular to the sun - galactic center line.
- $\beta = 3.5^\circ$ is the tilt angle between the bulge plane and the galactic plane.
- $\gamma = 91.3^\circ$ is the roll angle around the bulge major axis.
- $x_0 = 1.59$ kpc is the scale length along the major axis.
- $y_0 = 0.424$ kpc is the scale length along one of the minor axes.
- $z_0 = 0.424$ kpc is the scale length along the other minor axis.
- $R_c = 2.54$ kpc is the cutoff distance
- $N = 13.70 \text{ stars pc}^{-3}$ is the star density at the center of the bulge.

Note that contrary to the previous density laws, this is a number density.

#### Outer Bulge ($\sqrt{x_B^2+y_B^2} > R_c$)

$$\rho_N(x_B,y_B,z_B) = N \exp\left[ - 0.5 r_s^2 -0.2 \left( \sqrt{x_B^2 + y_B^2} - R_c\right)^2\right]  ,$$
where all parameters are the same as before.

Note that the formula in [Robin2010][Robin2010] contains a $e^{-5}$ inside the exponent. I am confident that this is a typo.

### Initial Mass Functions

The initial mass function $IMF$ is the distribution of masses of a newly formed star. It varies between populations, but is always modelled as a power law. 

For each IMF we can find an expectation value $\langle m \rangle$, which together with the expectation value of the total mass given by the density law can in turn be used to calculate the expected number of stars in a chunk:
$$\langle N \rangle = \frac{\langle m_{tot}\rangle}{\langle m \rangle}$$

Since the simulation of brown dwarfs is beyond the scope of this project, all distributions begin at $m> 0.07 M_\odot$, because this marks the minimal mass required to fuse hydrogen.

Table 4 of [Robin2010][Robin2010] lists it as follows:

#### Thin Disc

$ IMF(m) = A_1 m ^{-1.1} $, for  $ m < 0.6 M_\odot $,

$ IMF(m) = A_2 m^{-1.6} $, for $ 0.6 M_\odot < m < M_\odot $,

$ IMF(m) = A_3 m^{-3.0} $, for $ m > M_\odot $,

where
- $A_1 = TODO$
- $A_2 = TODO$
- $A_3 = TODO$

are chosen such that the function is continuous and normalised.

#### Thick Disc

$$IMF(m) = A m^{-0.5}  ,$$
where
- $A = TODO$ is a normalisation factor.

#### Spheroid

$$IMF(m) = A m^{-0.5}  ,$$ 
where
- $A = TODO$ is a normalisation factor.

#### Bulge

$$IMF(m) = A m^{-2.35}  ,$$ 
where
- this distribution begins at $m > 0.7 M_\odot$
- $A = TODO$ is a normalisation factor.

### Metallicity

The metallicity is defined as

$$\langle[\text{Fe/H}]\rangle = \log_{10}\left(\frac{N_\text{Fe}}{N_\text{H}}\right) _ \ast - \log _ {10}\left(\frac{N_\text{Fe}}{N_\text{H}}\right)_\odot ,$$


the logarithmic ratio of the number of iron and hydrogen atoms as compared to their ratio in the sun. It is measured in dex.

Table 5 of [Robin2010][Robin2010] lists the metallicities for the different populations as follows:

|Population|Age [Gyr]| $\langle[\text{Fe/H}]\rangle$ [dex] |
|---|---|---|
| Thin disc | $0-0.15$ | $0.01\pm0.010$ |
|| $0.15-1$ | $0.00\pm0.11$ |
|| $1-2$ | $-0.02\pm0.12$ |
|| $2-3$ | $-0.03\pm0.125$ |
|| $3-5$ | $-0.05\pm0.135$ |
|| $5-7$ | $-0.09\pm0.16$ |
|| $7-10$ | $-0.12\pm0.18$ |
| Thick disc | $11$ | $-0.50\pm0.30$ |
| Spheroid | $14$ | $-1.5\pm0.50$ |
| Bulge | $10$ | $0.00\pm0.20$ |

Note that in the thin disc, a radial metallcity dispersion of $-0.07$ dex/kpc is present.

### Luminous Intensity

Luminous intensity is a measure for the brightness of an object as perceived by the human eye. It is [defined](https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/candela) as the photometric power (the luminosity) radiated at a specific green wavelength.

In astronomy, luminous intensity as well as luminosity is typically measured in aboslute magnitude, which is a unitless number defined as the apparent magnitude the object would have at a distance of 10 parsecs (see Section 3.2 of [Luciuk2019][Luciuk2019]). The apparent magnitude $m$ in turn is defined as 

$$m=-2.5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) ,$$
where
- $L$ is the luminous intensity or luminosity of the object.
- $L_0$ is the luminous intensity or luminosity of the star Vega, which serves as the reference.

Absolute and apparent magnitude can be converted into one another via the equation:
$$m_\ast = M_\ast + 5 \log_{10}(d) -5 ,$$
where
- $m$ is the apparent magnitude.
- $M$ is the absolute magnitude.
- $d$ is the distance in units of parsec.

At a distance of 10 parsecs apparent and absolute magnitude are identical. The absolute magnitude can thus be found by comparing with the reference value of the sun:

$$M_\ast - M_\odot = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{L_\ast}{L_\odot} \right) .$$

The absolute magnitude of the sun is $4.8$.

Putting this in the equation above yields

$$ m _ \ast = M _ \odot - 2.5 \log _ {10} \left( \frac{L _ \ast}{L _ \odot} \right) + 5 \log _ {10}(d) -5 ,$$

which equals

$$ m _ \ast = -0.2 - 2.5 \log _ {10} \left( \frac{L _ \ast}{L _ \odot d^2} \right) .$$

The UrsaLumi input involves a limit of apparent magnitude $m_<$ below which an apparent magnitude must be to be included (remember that lower magnitudes somewhat unintuitively denote brighter stars).
Because computers are awfully slow at calculating logarithms, this condition can be transformed:

$$-0.2 - 2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{L_\ast}{L_\odot d^2} \right) < m_<$$

$$ \Leftrightarrow $$

$$ \frac{m_< - 0.2}{2.5} < \log_{10} \left( \frac{L_\ast}{L_\odot d^2} \right) $$

$$ \Leftrightarrow $$

$$ \frac{L_\ast}{L_\odot} > d^2 10^ \frac{m_< - 0.2}{2.5}$$

This defines an easy to calculate luminous intensity limit below which generated stars can be discarded.

To find the luminous intensity of a star, the [PARSEC data for stellar evolution trajectories](https://people.sissa.it/~sbressan/CAF09_V1.2S_M36_LT/) is used, which can be accessed via the [parsec_access](https://crates.io/crates/parsec_access) Rust crate.

Note that this makes a simplifiying assumption about the metallicity conversion from one unit to another explained [here](https://docs.rs/parsec_access/1.0.0/parsec_access/getters/fn.get_metallicities_in_fe_dex.html).

PARSEC further provides the bolometric luminosity (the total radiative power over all wavelength) in units of the solar bolometric luminosity. Here we assume that the luminous intensity of a star scales like the bolometric luminosity. Thus the numeric value provided by PARSEC can directly be used as $\frac{L}{L_\odot}$ in the equation above.

### Algorithm
- For each requested population calculate the expected number of stars within a chunk.
- Calculate the minimal luminous intensity needed to reach the magnitude limit at this distance.
- Sample the actual number of stars from a Poisson distribution.
- Generate the stars and assign
  - an initial mass, sampled from the IMF.
  - a metallicity sampled from a Gaussian distribution.
  - an age, depending on the population either uniformly distributed in the range, or at the time of a star formation burst.
- Calculate and assign the current mean luminous intensity.
- If the star is below the luminous intensity limit, discard it.
- Otherwise, assign
  - a 3D position sampled from a uniform distribution inside the chunk.
  - the current mass.
  - the effective temperature.
  - the population it belongs to.
